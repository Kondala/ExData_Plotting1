## Instructions for running the R scripts

Download and unzip the data file into a folder of your choice.  

Edit the setwd() command, the very first command of each script to point the working directory to the above folder.

Next, select all the lines of the script (e.g. with ctrl + A) and execute the lines.

Repeat this process for all the four .R files.
